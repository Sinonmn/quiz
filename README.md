## ⚙️ Architecture & AI Collaboration

This project is a result of human-AI collaboration:

- **Frontend**: Handcrafted by me using **React**. I focused on the UI, glassmorphism effects, and smooth user flow.
- **Backend**: The **Node.js/Express** server logic and database integration were **generated by AI** under my guidance to provide a robust API for the quiz data.
